# Car Park System

This is a simplified smart parking system developed.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts in Python.

This system simulates an uncontrolled car park that uses entry/exit sensors and digital displays to show available bays in real time.

## Features

- Track cars entering and exiting
- Update displays to reflect the number of available bays
- Log each carâ€™s movement to a file

## Technologies Used

- Python
- `unittest` for testing
- `pathlib` and `json` for file handling
- GitHub for version control
